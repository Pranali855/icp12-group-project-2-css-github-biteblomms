            <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p class="about-inner-text">BiteBlooms sprouted from late-night food adventures and a shared frustration - great meals were hard to discover. In 2023, our team of food-obsessed friends built what we wished existed: a platform that makes finding your next favorite restaurant as easy as chatting with a local foodie friend.
        We started small - photographing dishes, verifying every menu, testing each recommendation. Today, we've grown into a trusted guide helping millions discover exceptional dining experiences across the country, while staying true to our roots: honest recommendations from people who actually care about food.
